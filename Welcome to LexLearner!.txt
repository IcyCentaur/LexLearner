Welcome to LexLearner!

This is a fullstack tool that is designed to help to help users learn the alphabets of several different languages phonetically. 
Users can first see the pronunciation of all the alphabets and then test themselves on a set of 10 randomly selected letters from the selected language. 

Flow of the website: 
1. On initial visit, the user lands on the home page where they have to select a language. 
2. Then they are redirected to a page where they can study all the alphabets of the selected language along with their phonetic pronunciations. 
3. Once the user feels comfortable, they can test themselves using the "Take Quiz" option. 
4. They will now be redirected to a quiz where they will have to write the phonetic pronunciation of 10 alphabets.
5. Here, the alphabets will also be read aloud by the system to help the users.  
6. If they answer them correctly, a modal window pops up showing their score. 
7. The user can now either re-take the test with 10 different alphabets or go back to the landing page.
